```

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Regular Security Practices

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated monthly
- **Security Reviews**: Code reviews with security focus

### 🛠️ Running Security Audits

```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Generate security report
npm audit --audit-level moderate --json > security-audit.json

# Server-specific security check
cd server && npm audit --production

# Client-specific security check
cd client && npm audit --production
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### 🔒 Environment Variables

**Sensitive Information** (Never commit to repository):
- MongoDB connection strings
- Mapbox API tokens
- API keys and secrets
- Production URLs

**Safe in Repository**:
- Port numbers
- Cache timeout values
- Log levels
- Feature flags

### 🌐 API Security

**Rate Limiting**:
- 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Configurable limits based on endpoint

**Input Validation**:
- All API inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention
- NoSQL injection prevention

**Authentication** (Future):
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management

## 🛡️ Deployment Security

### 🚀 Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **HTTPS Only**: SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] **Database Security**: MongoDB authentication enabled
- [ ] **Firewall Rules**: Only necessary ports exposed
- [ ] **Regular Updates**: OS and dependencies updated
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Backups**: Encrypted backups configured
- [ ] **Access Control**: Limited server access

### 🐳 Docker Security

```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
USER node

# Don't include sensitive files
.dockerignore includes:
- .env
- *.log
- node_modules
```

## 🚨 Incident Response Plan

- **GitHub Security Advisory**: For confirmed vulnerabilities
- **Email Notifications**: To security contact list
- **Public Disclosure**: After incident resolution

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### 👨‍💻 Developer Guidelines

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Validate all inputs** from users and external sources
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection attacks
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Follow secure coding practices** in all contributions
6. **Keep dependencies updated** and check for vulnerabilities

### 🧪 Security Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
